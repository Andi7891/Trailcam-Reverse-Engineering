**Recovering and Repairing a Faulty Trail Camera Firmware

*Overview
This project began unintentionally after acquiring a second-hand trail camera that failed to power on. Investigation revealed that the device was running on a U-Boot bootloader with a Linux 3.10.14-Archon kernel (Linux/MIPS). The firmware exhibited a crash loop, restarting approximately every 8 seconds, making the device unusable.

*Initial Diagnostics

Hardware & Boot Output Analysis

Connected to the camera via UART to capture boot logs.

Confirmed U-Boot bootloader and Linux/MIPS architecture.

Firmware Access Attempts

Attempted brute-force password recovery for root access — unsuccessful.

Hypothesized that replacing the password hash in the firmware with a known hash could enable login after reflashing.

Partial Filesystem Recovery

Managed to scrape files from the root filesystem in short windows before the device restarted.

Retrieved Bluetooth and Wi-Fi driver binaries, but no login scripts were found.

*Root Cause Analysis
While examining firmware strings, I noticed configuration values related to image resolution. Prior research into the ISVP camera framework revealed that image resolution directly affects required memory allocation. A configuration file was requesting a resolution requiring more memory than the device had available, causing the main camera process to crash and trigger the watchdog reset.

*Solution

Extracted firmware and located resolution settings using a hex editor.

Reduced the resolution to match the device’s RAM capabilities.

Reflashed the modified firmware.

*Result
The camera booted successfully without entering a crash loop, restoring full functionality.

*Key Technical Points

Low-level debugging via UART

Linux/MIPS firmware inspection

Direct binary patching via hex editing

Embedded system watchdog behavior analysis

Add custom firmware features and improved user accessibility
